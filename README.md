Thanks For Using doeralex-webdevs Visual Studio code and git installing tool.

When you Open a .sh File always press "Open in Terminal"

To install the Browser you must prepair one thing.

First you put the .zip file on your desktop.

Then you unpack the .zip file.

The last step of Prepairing is to open the Terminal with Ctrl + alt +T (German Keybord: Strg + alt + T) and type the following in the Terminal: chmod +x $(xdg-user-dir DESKTOP)/Visual-Studio-Code-main/installer.sh

To install open the File "installer.sh". After installing the Terminal tell you: "Visual Studio Code succesfull installed. Press Enter to close the Window."
Now you must press enter. 

After that you can open it like your other Applications.
